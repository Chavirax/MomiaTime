//The Authorize attribute can be applied without arguments, which restricts access to any authenticated user. The Roles
//argument is used to further restrict access to users who are members of specific roles, which are expressed as a comma-separated 
//list. The attribute in this listing restricts access to users assigned to the Admins role. The authorization restrictions are inherited,
//which means that applying the attribute to the base class restricts access to all the Razor Pages created to manage users and roles
